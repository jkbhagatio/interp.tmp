# interp.tmp
A temporary repo containing some files for some current projects I am working on in Mech Interp that I have permission to publicly share.

`./mini/ ` (**M**echanistic **I**nterpretability for **N**eural **I**nterpretability) contains a notebook showing an old working pipeline for training an SAE on biological neural data and finding SAE features that correspond to "natural" visual features that are presumably encoded through sensation and/or perception in visual cortex. The main proejct goal is to use SAEs to find interpretable, biological neural features that encode natural features.

`./toy_cis/` (Toy Models of Computation in Superposition) contains a small module containing code for a generalizable simple model class (the same class can be used to construct various toy models from Anthropic and Apollo), and an early version of a notebook that constructs two of these toy models and visualizes results from them after training. Unfortunately, I can't yet share a more comprhensive comparison and evaluation we've done of a few different toy models that exhibit computation in superposition! The main project goal is to illustrate how Anthropic's explanation of computation in superposition isn't generalizable to other models that perform computation in superposition, and to find a satisfying general mechanism explaining computation in superposition.
